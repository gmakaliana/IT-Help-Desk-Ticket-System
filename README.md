# IT-Help-Desk-Ticket-System (HESK)

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to simulate a real-world IT Helpdesk environment using the HESK ticketing system. The project focuses on practicing ticket creation, troubleshooting, documentation, and knowledgebase development in a small local network setup.

## Tools Used
-Laptop (IT Admin / Technician)
-Desktop Computer (End User)
-D-Link Network Switch
-Ethernet Cables
-Windows Operating Systems
-XAMPP (Apache, MySQL, PHP)
-HESK Ticketing System

## Network Setup
A small Local Area Network (LAN) was created using a D-Link switch.
Both the Laptop and Desktop computer were connected to the switch using Ethernet cables and configured within the same subnet to allow communication and access to the HESK system hosted on the laptop.

## Ticket Workflow
1. User submits a ticket from the desktop computer
2. Ticket is received in the HESK admin panel
3. Technician reviews the issue
4. Troubleshooting is performed
5. Root cause and resolution are documented in the ticket
6. Ticket is resolved and closed
7. Reusable solutions are documented as KnowledgeBase articles

## Skills Demonstrated
-IT Helpdesk operations
-Hardware troubleshooting
-Software installation and configuration
-Basic networking and LAN troubleshooting 
-Ticket documentation and communication 
-KnowledgeBase creation
-Use of web-based ticketing systems 
-Professional IT workflow and reporting 

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates hands-on experience with a helpdesk ticketing system in a simulated work environment. It reflects real IT support processes used in organizations and prepares the technician for entry-level IT support and helpdesk roles.
